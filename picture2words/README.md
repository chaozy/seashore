This program is used to convert a bitmap image to a text 'picture' which is consituted by characters.
The flaw is in most of the cases, the size of the text 'picture' has to be adjusted manually to get a clear image. 

Running: change the address of the image in the code to the one you want to play with, then run the program in terminal. This will create a txt file which contains the text 'picture'.
